# Third-party API's Daily Planner

## Usage
This website allows you to input events happening at hourly intervals throughout the work day. These will be stored in the local storage until the 'clear diary' button is clicked.

The current date and time is displayed at the top of the page, and the time slots are colour coded. Grey for past time slots, a bold green for the current hour, and a light green for future time slots. Once the event has been inputted, the 'save' button will store the text in the HTML and also in the local storage.This information will be stored in the storage and be displayed, even after page reload, until the clear button is clicked.
